Hobbies are making games, playing games, reading books, watching animations. The advantage of myself is that I am very strict with the code, whether it is the relationship between classes or the naming of variables; the disadvantage is that sometimes I spend a lot of time in a few lines for the readability and cleanliness of the code... The dream is to find a group of like-minded people to develop independent games in the future.</p>"

The main duties are to develop HTML5 cross-platform slot games, maintain old games and game framework, develop game prototypes, and write game feature documents and API documents. The programming language used in the work is TypeScript, the game framework is developed and maintained by the company itself, and the rendering engine is Pixi.js. During the job, I has developed five games, assisted in the development of three games, and developed the prototypes of two games (the main purpose of the prototype is to show the game designer whether the volatility, payout, and features of the slot game are what he expected look). Among them, I think the most interesting task is to develop the prototype of the game, because only at this process can I get access to the most important data processing. The states of the game and whether the performance is correct depends on whether the feature data formatters of my is written correctly. If the data has incorrect or lacking, I need to report to the back-end engineer I cooperated with. Finally, to make sure that the front-end engineer who takes over doesn't have a headache, so I always have to think carefully about the rationality of data planning and readability. All in all, I have learned a lot and met a lot of good colleagues here. It is a very meaningful time  for meüòä</p>"
